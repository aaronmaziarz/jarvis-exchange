# Chronos - Founder Spec

*The AI Task Management App That Puts Users First*

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2026-03-11  
**Status:** Draft - Ready for Review

---

## The Problem

Current task management apps force a choice:

| App | What's Wrong |
|-----|-------------|
| **Motion** | Expensive, feature-bloated, pushes unwanted AI, removed free features |
| **Akiflow** | No native Mac app, limited AI, removed free tier |
| **Everything Else** | Manual scheduling only - no AI help |

Users just want their tasks scheduled. They're tired of:
- 🤖 AI features they didn't ask for
- 💰 Hidden price increases
- 📱 Missing native apps (Mac/iPhone)
- 📚 Steep learning curves
- 😤 Being forced to upgrade

---

## Our Solution: Chronos

**Slogan:** "Your tasks, scheduled. Simply."

Chronos is an AI-powered task management app that:
1. **Schedules automatically** - But gives you full control
2. **Has native apps** - Mac + iPhone (not just web)
3. **Transparent pricing** - No hidden changes
4. **Optional AI** - AI assists, doesn't override
5. **Social planning** - Plan with friends (unique!)

---

## Market Opportunity

### The Problem We Solve
- **Motion users** are looking for alternatives (see: Reddit threads titled "ditching Motion")
- **Akiflow users** want native apps and more AI
- **Nobody** has social planning + flexible event types

### Target Users
1. **Productivity power users** - Want AI scheduling without bloat
2. **Professionals** - Need native Mac + iPhone apps
3. **Teams** - Want to coordinate schedules with colleagues
4. **Casual users** - Need a generous free tier

### Market Size
- Task management: $4.5B market (2024)
- AI productivity tools: Growing 25% annually
- Motion costs $20-30/mo - users are unhappy paying more for less
